# jkit

Spec-driven development for Java/Spring Boot microservice teams.

`jkit` is a Claude Code plugin that brings a structured TDD and contract workflow to AI-assisted Java development. It combines a set of Claude skills covering the full development cycle with a Rust CLI (`bin/jkit`) that gives those skills token-efficient, machine-readable views of your Java project — so Claude makes decisions from compact JSON summaries rather than raw XML and source files.

**What's included:**

- 8 Claude skills covering the full dev cycle: project bootstrap, spec delta, unit TDD, integration test TDD, coverage gating, contract publishing, SQL migration authoring, and Feign client generation
- `bin/jkit` — a Rust CLI for Java project pipeline operations (pom fragment management, JaCoCo coverage gaps, scenario gap detection, schema migration diff/place, contract bundle staging)
- `bin/kit` — a language-agnostic companion CLI for cross-cutting operations (plan/plugin status, scenario sync/skip, contract publish)
- `bin/codeskel` — a polyglot project scanner used during contract generation
- Hook-injected project context that keeps skills consistent across Claude sessions

## Install

```bash
claude plugin install jkit
```

If your service consumes upstream contracts from other teams, install their contract plugins as dependencies:

```bash
bin/install-contracts.sh
```

## Skills workflow

The skills form a pipeline. On a fresh repo, run `/migrate-project` once to bootstrap. After that, every cycle starts at `/spec-delta` and follows the chain through to `/java-verify` before publishing.

### `/migrate-project`

One-time bootstrap. Creates `docs/changes/{pending,done}/` and explains how to write your first change file. Idempotent — safe to re-run.

### `/spec-delta`

Start here for every cycle. Picks up pending change files in `docs/changes/pending/`, infers affected domains, updates the formal docs (`api-spec.yaml`, `domain-model.md`, `api-implement-logic.md`), runs scenario-gap detection, and produces a `change-summary.md` for your approval — before any code is written. Everything downstream derives from this change summary.

### `/java-tdd`

Implements a plan via strict TDD: a failing unit test must exist before any implementation code is written. After each red → green cycle, JaCoCo coverage gaps are analysed and fed back into the next test. No exceptions and no "write the test after" — tests written against already-passing code prove nothing.

### `/scenario-tdd`

Implements integration test gaps one scenario at a time, driven by the gap list in `change-summary.md`. Each scenario follows a strict RED → GREEN loop using RestAssured against a live Testcontainers stack. Batch generation is not allowed — one failing test, then implementation, then the next scenario.

### `/java-verify`

Runs the full quality gate: `mvn verify`, merged JaCoCo unit and integration coverage, API endpoint coverage check (declared spec endpoints vs RestAssured-tested endpoints), then hands off to code review. This is the exit gate before a PR is raised.

### `/publish-contract`

Generates the 4-level service contract — a SKILL.md skill definition plus per-domain markdown docs — and pushes it to the contract plugin repo and registers it in the marketplace. Requires Javadoc on all controller methods; the skill enforces this before generating anything.

### `/generate-feign`

Generates a type-safe Feign client from an installed upstream contract plugin. Run this after `bin/install-contracts.sh` to wire a dependency's API into your service.

### `/sql-migration`

Guides authoring of Liquibase or Flyway migrations aligned with the current spec. Reads schema analysis from the change summary and produces migration files that match the intended schema state.

## `bin/` tools

**`bin/jkit`** is the Java-pipeline Rust CLI. It reads raw project files and outputs compact JSON — no prose, no color, machine-readable by default. Use `--pretty` for human-readable output during development.

**`bin/kit`** is the language-agnostic companion CLI used by skills that aren't Java-specific (plan/plugin state, scenario sync/skip, contract publish).

**`bin/codeskel`** is a polyglot project scanner used by the contract-generation flow.

**`bin/install-contracts.sh`** installs upstream service contract plugins listed in `.claude/settings.json` as Claude plugin dependencies, making their skills and domain docs available locally.

Pom-fragment installation is now handled by the `jkit pom` subcommand (see `docs/jkit-pom-prd.md`). The previous `bin/pom-add.sh` shell script has been removed.

## External tooling

Some skills shell out to third-party tools that must be on `PATH`:

| Tool | Used by | Install |
|---|---|---|
| `openapi-generator-cli` | `generate-feign` (OpenAPI → Feign Java client) | `npm i -g @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli` or `brew install openapi-generator` |
| `mvn` | `java-tdd`, `java-verify`, `scenario-tdd`, `publish-contract` (smart-doc) | Standard Maven distribution |
| `docker compose` / `podman compose` | `scenario-tdd` (Spring Boot < 3.1 integration tests) | Docker Desktop, Docker Engine, or Podman |
| `psql` (or other DB client) | `sql-migration` (live-schema introspection) | `brew install postgresql` / distro package |

## Contributing

Clone the repo and work directly against `main`. Skills live in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — each file is a self-contained skill definition consumed by Claude Code. The `bin/jkit` binary is pre-built from Rust source described in `docs/jkit-cli-prd.md`; rebuild with `cargo build --release` and replace the platform binary in `bin/`.

Commit prefix conventions are required — `java-tdd` calls `jkit changes complete` on a final `(impl):` commit to move processed change files from `docs/changes/pending/` to `docs/changes/done/` and archive the run dir:

| Prefix | When to use |
|---|---|
| `docs(spec):` or `docs(<domain>):` | Spec change in `docs/domains/` |
| `feat(impl):` | New feature implementation |
| `fix(impl):` | Bug fix implementation |
| `chore(impl):` | Non-feature implementation work |
